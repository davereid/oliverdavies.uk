# About

Hi, I'm Oliver Davies - a [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/about) Developer and Systems Administrator based in Wales. I work for the [Drupal Association](https://assoc.drupal.org/about) Engineering team, working on Drupal.org, it's sub-sites and infrastructure, as well as providing part-time freelance services.

I'm an active member of the Drupal and PHP communities - organising and [speaking](/talks/) at user groups and conferences, mentoring at DrupalCons, and contributing code to core and various contrib modules and themes. I'm the Git Documentation Maintainer for the Drupal project and a provisional member of the [Drupal Security team](https://www.drupal.org/security-team).

I also have experience of building websites using static site generators, namely [Sculpin](http://sculpin.io) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

I have active social media profiles on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/opdavies) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/opdavies), and you can view my code on [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/user/381388/track/code) and [GitHub](https://www.github.com/opdavies?tab=activity).
