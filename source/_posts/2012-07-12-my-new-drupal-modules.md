After a busy few days, I've released two new contrib Drupal modules:

* [Block Aria Landmark Roles](http://drupal.org/project/block_aria_landmark_roles) - Inspired by [Block Class](http://drupal.org/project/block_class), this module adds additional elements to the block configuration forms that allow users to assign a ARIA landmark role to a block.
* [Nomensa Accessible Media Player](http://drupal.org/project/nomensa_amp) - Provides integration with Nomensa's [Accessible Media Player](https://github.com/nomensa/Accessible-Media-Player).

Documentation for both to follow shortly on Drupal.org.
