A lot happened last year. Here are some of the main things:

## My First DrupalCamp

In February, I attended [DrupalCamp London](http://2014.drupalcamplondon.co.uk). This was my first time attending a Camp, and I managed to attend some great sessions as well as meet people who I'd never previously met in person. I was also a volunteer and speaker, where I talked about [Git Flow](/blog/what-git-flow/) - a workflow for managing your Git projects.

I was also able to do a little bit of sprinting whilst I was there, reviewing other people's modules and patches.

Attending this and [DrupalCon Prague](https://prague2013.drupal.org) in 2013 have really opened my eyes to the face-to-face side of the Drupal community, and I plan on attending a lot more Camps and Cons in the future.

## Joined the Drupal Association

In May, I started a new job working as a Developer for the [Drupal Association](https://assoc.drupal.org/about "About the Drupal Association"), working on [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org) where I was able to do some very interesting work.
I was also able to travel to Portland, Oregon, USA twice last year to meet with the rest of the Association staff. Both times I met new people and it was great to spend some work and social time with everyone, and it was great to have everyone together as a team.

## DrupalCon Amsterdam

I was also able to travel to Holland and attend [DrupalCon Amsterdam](https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org) along with other members of Association staff. 

## DrupalCamp Bristol

In October, we started planning for [DrupalCamp Bristol](http://www.drupalcampbristol.co.uk). I'm one of the founding Committee members,
