It's all booked, I'm going to be attending [DrupalCamp London](http://2014.drupalcamplondon.co.uk).

I'm going as a volunteer, so I'm going to be helping with the registrations on the Saturday morning and for another couple hours elsewhere over the weekend. I've also offered to help organise and oversee some code sprints, although I'm definitely wanting to do some sprinting of my own and attend a few sessions.

I'm looking forward to meeting some new people as well as catching up with some people that I met at [DrupalCon Prague](http://prague2013.drupal.org).

If you're also coming, see you there!

**Update:** I've just found out that my session, [What is Git Flow?](http://2014.drupalcamplondon.co.uk/drupalcamp-london-2014/session/what-git-flow "Information about the session on the DrupalCamp website"), has been accepted and will take place on the Sunday morning. It's going to be a busy weekend!
